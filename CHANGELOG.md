3.0.0 / 2019-01-03
==================

Breaking change:
  * [Bugfix] fixing issue where generated file name is not the id
    * While this is really a bugfix relase, the side-effect of the release will be a change to the location of some of the files. As this file location constitutes some people's **public APIs** it requires this to be a Major Version bump
